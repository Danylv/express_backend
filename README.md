This is minimal API server to populate with data frontend React App, my another pet project https://github.com/Danylv/pulsar_productiona_plan/tree/main

Data goes from old database standarts source, from one dbf-format file. The only one fun—Åtion-trigger accept requests from frontend and populates React table on another side without any authentication or confirmations.

Need only NodeJS to start this API server and React web app from link below!

Installation:
1. <b>npm install<b>
2. <b>npm start<b>
